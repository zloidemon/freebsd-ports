I've written a C interface that can be used to integrate AngelScript with other
languages than C++, for example C, Delphi, Pascal, etc. As it is not part of
the standard SDK I do not keep it updated with every release, but it is quite
easy to update for the latest release when needed, so don't hesitate to let me
know if you'd like to have it updated.
